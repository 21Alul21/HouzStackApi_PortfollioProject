This project is an open source project that integrates Machine Learning(ML) in API development, for predicting rent of houses in
Nigeria, UK, India and Canada.

The ML model for this API project was built using Dataset gotten from Kaggle.com.

The algorithm used for building the models is the catboost algorithm.

Each  prediction endpoint is linked to a specific ML model.
